# Brian Kruse Individual Project - Grocery Assistant

### Problem Statement

As someone who cooks real meals on a daily basis the pre-grocery shopping experience can leave something to be desired.  
It can take our family up to 2 hours to decide what to eat, make a list, and get out the door.  
My hope is to not only make this process faster, but easier and more user friendly in the process.  

This application will allow the user to input the recipe requirements or create a template to represent  a given dish.  
The user will be able to select from their created recipe or template meal ideas.  
The application will pull up all ingredients needed to complete the meal plan you selected.  
The application will format the output into a printable sheet you can take with you to the grocery store.
